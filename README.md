IRTracking
==========

 Here's my most recent (and elaborated) ActionScript 3 project up to date (once AS3 has definitely become my proficient and standard scripting language), the same one mentioned in the last post. It involves, experimentally, hardware and short-range wireless connections.
  You can find the download link to the Flash file (SWF) above, and to try it you will need a PC with a Bluetooth radio and a WiiMote (hurry, before there's onlu WiiUs left!).
 Before opening the SWF, connect the Wii Remote to the PC using the WiiFlash sercer (link above, follow instructions) and light up two infrared lights (you can use the Wii Sensor Bar, it's just two IV LED clusters). Placing the remote in a flat surface facing the user, it should be possible to control the sphere on the screen by moving the LEDs.
